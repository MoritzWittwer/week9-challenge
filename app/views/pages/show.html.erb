        Morioka (盛岡) is the capital city of <a href="#">Iwate Prefecture</a>, 2.5 hours by
        shinkansen north of <a href="#">Tokyo</a>. Surrounded by mountains on three sides and
        blessed with multiple rivers, Morioka is an attractive city and a
        convenient transportation hub, but lacks a major sightseeing spot.
        The city is well known for its various styles of noodles, though,
        and does offer a handful of minor sites of interest.

        <h3>Wanko Soba</h3>
        <p>
          Eating Wanko Soba is an experience in itself. Each serving contains
          roughly a mouthful of soba noodles, and the server will constantly keep
          topping up your empty bowl with more noodles until you indicate that you
          have had enough.
